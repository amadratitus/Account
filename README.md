## Question 1
Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers,
One called as savings account and the other as current account. The
savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities
but no cheque book facility. The current account provides cheque
book facility but no interest. Both account holders should also maintain a minimum balance and if the balance falls below this level, a
service charge is imposed.
Create a class called Account to represent a bank Account.
From this derive the classes Curr_Account, and Sav_Account to
make them more specific to their requirements. Include the necessary
Data members and member functions . Some of the class members
may include:
### Data members
 - Name of the depositor
 - Account number
 - Type of account
 - Balance amount in the account.
 - etc
### Member functions such as:
 - To assign initial values
 - Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance
 - To withdraw an amount after checking the balance
 - To display the name and balance
 - Compute and deposit interest
 - Permit withdrawal and update the balance
 - Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, necessary, and update the balance
 - etc

The programme should be able to handle at least 100 customers. Include constructors/destructors in your program where required.</p>
